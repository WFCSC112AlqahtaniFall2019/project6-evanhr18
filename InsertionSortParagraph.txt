Binary Insertion Sort for a vector and Insertion Sort for a linked list are different in a few ways. First, binary sort allows for fewer comparisons than regular insertion sort. For smaller arrays, insertion sort is still quite fast, but in its worst case, with very large arrays, binary sort can be more efficient. The binary insertion sort code is also shorter and more efficient than my insertion sort code.
